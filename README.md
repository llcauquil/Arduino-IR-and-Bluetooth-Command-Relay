# Arduino-IR-and-Bluetooth-Command-Relay
Arduino Uno operates as a bluetooth node for either a phone or centralized Raspberry Pi module, converting a bluetooth command into a pre-recorded IR message. Arduino has option to record and replay designated IR blasts to control IR devices, such as RGB LED lights and TV settings.

Goal is to combine the circuit diagrams from the library example of IRrecord and an HC-05 Bluetooth module. Links to each part of this project are posted on this github rep.
